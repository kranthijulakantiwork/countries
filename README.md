## Design choices, assumptions, and explanation of SSG/SSR choices.

- For styling used tailwindcss as it is enables faster development, maintainability and simplifies creation of responsive design and easier to scale.
- Used Shadcn components, as they are plain and easily customizable.
- Used SSR across home page and country details page as they have data fetching and loading will be faster with SSR.
- Used client side rendering across login and favorites, as there is not much dynamic data from server.

# Explanation of your chosen state management solution.

- For State management, used redux toolkit as it is simple to implement and has inbuilt RTK query which has inbuilt caching feature.
